== Getting Started

ClusterJob (CJ) is an automation system for high-throughput reproducible computations. Using CJ, one can conduct large-scale computational studies on remote clusters in a hassle-free and reproducible manner. CJ builds 'reproducible' computational packages that are easy to share with others. 
It is written mainly in perl and has simple commands that are easy to learn. The project started at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho with the goal of making large-scale scientific computing simpler and more efficient. Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. In future, we hope to include other heavily used programming languages such as R and Python.
