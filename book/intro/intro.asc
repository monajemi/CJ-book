== Getting Started

ClusterJob (CJ) is an automation system for massive computational experiments. Using CJ, one can conduct large-scale computational studies on remote clusters in a painless and reproducible manner. CJ builds 'reproducible' computational packages that are easy to reuse and share with others. 
CJ is written mainly in perl and has simple commands that are easy to learn. The project started at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho with the goal of making large-scale scientific computing simpler and more efficient. Current implementation allows submission of Matlab and Python jobs.
