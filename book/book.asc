== Introduction

Clusterjob (CJ) is a system for automatizing reproducibility and hassle-free submission of computational jobs to remote cluster from your local machine. CJ is written in perl language and produces 'reporoducible' computational packages for academic publications. The project started at Stanford University by Hatef Monajemi and his PhD advisor David L. Donoho to make the large-scale scientific computing tasks more efficient. Current implementation allows submission of MATLAB jobs. In the future versions, we hope to include other heavily used programming languages such as Python, and R.
